### More about me
I am a Technical Business Intelligence professional with over ten years of experience in multinational companies, I love utilizing technical tools to answer business questions and help shape better strategies. With a solid background in marketing research, I have managed internal analytics initiatives, including a data lake cluster that leverages open source projects (see Project section for more details) to provide on-demand reporting and self-exploration to employees. 

I am passionate about data analytics and interested in growing in data science. When not studing new tools, I like spending time with my family.
